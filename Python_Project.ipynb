According to the Clinical Trials website, run by the National Institutes of Health, participants must be at least 14 years old and 18-24 weeks pregnant.The controversial study, led by Bliss Kaneshiro, MD and Kate Whitehouse, DO, will monitor bleeding during D&E abortions to determine the effects of the drug oxytocin, commonly used to minimize blood loss and decrease the risk of hemorrhage.The clinical trial, called  Effects of Oxytocin on Bleeding Outcomes during Dilation and Evacuation  began in October 2014 and is a collaboration between UH, Society of Family Planning and the University of Washington.The Society of Family Planning funds a number of similar research projects, such as experimenting with the dosage of Misoprostol, a uterine contracting agent, prior to surgical abortions at 13-18 weeks and exploring umbilical cord injections to produce fetal death prior to late-term abortions.In the UH study, researchers will carry out a  randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials,  to determine the effect of oxytocin s use on uterine bleeding, meaning that they will either provide or deny intravenous oxytocin to the women.Reports suggest that some doctors are concerned that withholding oxytocin during surgery may put patients, especially teen girls, at risk. This study is reminiscent of Nazi concentration camp experiments. I pity the poor women who are being treated like lab rats, especially those who are denied the drug to reduce hemorrhaging,  said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue.Dilation and evacuation abortions are surgical procedures that involve dismembering the pre-born baby with forceps, scraping the inside of the uterus with a curette to remove any residuals and finally suctioning out the womb to make sure the contents are completely removed.After the abortion, the corpse of the fetus is reassembled and examined to ensure everything was successfully removed and that the abortion was complete.The study is hoping to attract up to 166 test subjects and is expected to conclude in July 2015.Via: Breitbart News\",\n          \"CNN was quick to scoop up Corey Lewandowski after Donald Trump kicked him out of his role as campaign manager, but his first week on the job is going pretty much exactly how you would expect it to go   terribly.Not only has Lewandowski proven himself to be pretty much like a paid spokesman for Trump, but his defense of the disgraced GOP candidate isn t being received well. Earlier this week, Lewandowski revealed that he was under contract and couldn t criticize The Donald, even after being fired from the campaign. Today, Lewandowski got called out by Hillary Clinton surrogate Christine Quinn for hyping Trump up to be an expert on the Brexit decision   a suggestion that was clearly false.On Monday s edition of CNN s New Day, Lewandowski made another pathetic defense of Trump by trying to reframe the candidate s disgusting reaction to Brexit, where he mostly spoke about how much the decision would be good for his Scotland golf resort. Lewandowski s defense was: Obviously the U.S. dollar has become much stronger now against the British pound. If you re going to spend money in Europe, now would actually be a good time to go with the fall of the pound.What you have is a world view, so what you have is someone who is saying,  Let s look at this from the U.S. perspective. If you want to go and travel overseas   just from a monetary perspective   now is the right time to do that because what you re getting is more for your dollar. Quinn wasn t having it. She ripped into Lewandowski, firing back, Donald Trump is not running to be travel agent of the world, he s running to be president of the United States.  She continued: What he said wasn t a commentary on international markets, it was,  When the pound goes down, more people will come to my golf course. Donald Trump s main concern isn t the international markets, it isn t the impact that Brexit will have on hard working Americans  401Ks, it s himself. How can he make more money, how can he put more money in his bank account? Lewandowski compared the Brexit decision to Trump s rise in the GOP, and Quinn once again called him out and put him back in his place. She said: Trump touted that he saw this coming. That s ridiculous because when he was first asked about Brexit by the press, he didn t appear to know what it was. Lewandowski tried to counter by insisting that People are too smart, they are tired of being told what to do.  He then tried to commend Trump for being a selfish moron: You know what Donald Trump said about Brexit? What he said was, you don t have to listen to me because it s not my decision. He didn t weigh in like Hillary Clinton did, like Barack Obama did, saying that you can t do this. Quinn fought back, Because he didn t know what it was. Lewandowski was fighting a losing battle. Trump s reaction to Brexit was just as terrifying as it was humorous   it truly proved that Trump knows nothing about foreign affairs, and hasn t spent any time educating himself since the beginning of his presidential candidacy. If only some of the hours he spent getting into fights on Twitter were being used for learning about how the world works. But instead, he once again exposed himself as an unfit choice for President. And when people like Lewandowski try to make sense of his idiocy, they only make themselves look equally foolish.You can watch the embarrassing video below:Featured image via screen capture\",\n          \"A Michigan woman decided to defend against tyranny? when she and another shopper couldn t agree over who got to buy the last notebook on the shelf at the Novi Towne Center store.According to ABC 13, the brawl   yes, brawl    involved two Farmington Hills residents, ages 46 and 32, and a mother and daughter from South Lyon, ages 51 and 20. In other words, these were all grown adults who should have known better but hey   there was only one notebook on the shelf, and we ve all seen what happens in those post-apocalyptic movies when a store is down to the last gallon of milk, right?Two of the women, one of whom was the unnamed 20-year-old, reached for the notebook at the same time. The 46 and 32-year-olds apparently decided that she wasn t getting their goddamn notebook and began pulling her hair.Then, because this had almost hit peak  trailer park,  the 20-year-old s mother decided to go for bonus points by pulling out her gun. Fortunately, someone pushed her aside before she could do any harm.This is one of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  (conservatives can t dismiss this one, as it is confirmed that she is a concealed carry permit holder)   ready to leap into action at the most minor sign of danger and make things worse by turning the situation potentially deadly.Watch it happen below:Featured image via screengrab\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Middle-east\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1681,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jun 5, 2015\",\n          \"August 28, 2016\",\n          \"June 3, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The legislation would provide $36.5 billion in emergency relief as Puerto Rico in particular struggles to regain electricity and other basic services following destructive hurricanes. The House of Representatives approved the bill earlier this month. The Trump administration already has indicated it will seek another round of emergency relief from Congress. \",\n          \"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - About a thousand Hungarians protested on Friday against a crackdown on the main opposition party Jobbik which has been  threatened by a record political campaign fine that the party leader describes as a  death sentence  for democracy. Despite the gloomy rhetoric and Jobbik saying it was fighting for survival, support for the demonstration was well down on other similar rallies over the past year. Hungarians will vote for a new parliament in April and Prime Minister Viktor Orban s conservative, anti-migrant Fidesz party is far ahead in the polls, with Jobbik its nearest rival. Jobbik, once on the far right, has turned toward the center in a bid to attract more support and is now campaigning nationwide against Orban, depicting him as the leader of a criminal gang. Orban, rejecting the charges, says his financial standing is  an open book . Last week the state audit office (ASZ) ruled Jobbik had bought political posters far below market prices, breaching rules on political funding, then it slapped a 663 million forint ($2.5 million) penalty on the party. The protesters, waving Jobbik flags and posters deriding the ruling elite, gathered outside the headquarters of Orban s Fidesz party.  What we see unfolding is not an audit office investigation. It is not an official penalty. This is a death sentence with Jobbik s name on it. But in reality, it is a death sentence for Hungarian democracy,  Jobbiik leader Gabor Vona told the crowd. A government spokesman could not comment immediately on his remarks. ASZ chairman Laszlo Domokos is a former Fidesz lawmaker, whom Jobbik and other critics accuse of making decisions in favor of Orban. The audit office denies that. On Friday, ASZ again called on Jobbik to submit information that would challenge its findings, saying it acted fully within its rights throughout the probe. The ruling Fidesz party and the government have denied any involvement in the ASZ probe.  This case has nothing to do with the election campaign,  Orban aide Janos Lazar said on Thursday. For over a year Fidesz has targeted Jobbik, whose move to the center could upend the longstanding status quo of a dominant Fidesz with weaker opponents to its left and its right, said analyst Zoltan Novak at the Centre for Fair Political Analysis. Gyorgy Illes, a 67-year-old pensioner attending the rally, said he used to be a Socialist supporter but got disillusioned as the party struggled to overcome its internal divisions.  This ASZ probe is a clear sign that Orban is way past any remedy. It is a ruthless attack on everything we hold dear. Democracy, the rule of law, equality, you name it,  he said. \",\n          \"BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China accused the United States on Thursday of interfering in its internal affairs and said it had lodged a complaint after U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law an act laying the groundwork for possible U.S. navy visits to self-ruled Taiwan. Tensions have risen in recent days after a senior Chinese diplomat threatened China would invade Taiwan if any U.S. warships made port visits to the island which China claims as its own territory. On Monday, Chinese jets carried out  island encirclement patrols  around Taiwan, with state media showing pictures of bombers with cruise missiles slung under their wings as they carried out the exercise. On Tuesday, Trump signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes the possibility of mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States. Such visits would be the first since the United States ended formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 and established ties with Beijing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said while the Taiwan sections of the law were not legally binding, they seriously violate the  One China  policy and  constitute an interference in China s internal affairs .   China is resolutely opposed to this, and we have already lodged stern representations with the U.S. government,  Lu told a daily news briefing. China is firmly opposed to any official exchanges, military contact, or arms sales between Taiwan and the United States, he added.  Proudly democratic Taiwan has become increasingly concerned with the ramped up Chinese military presence, that has included several rounds of Chinese air force drills around the island in recent months.  Taiwan is confident of its defenses and responded quickly to the Chinese air force drills this week, its government said, denouncing the rise in China s military deployments as irresponsible. Taiwan presidential spokesman Alex Huang, speaking to Taiwan media in comments reported late on Wednesday, said the defense ministry had kept a close watch on the patrols and responded immediately and properly. Taiwan  can ensure there are no concerns at all about national security, and people can rest assured , Huang said. Both sides of the narrow Taiwan Strait, which separates Taiwan from its giant neighbor, have a responsibility to protect peace and stability, he added.  Such a raised military posture that may impact upon and harm regional peace and stability and cross-strait ties does not give a feeling of responsibility, and the international community does not look favorably upon this,  Huang was quoted as saying. Relations have soured considerably since Tsai Ing-wen, who leads Taiwan s independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, won presidential elections last year. China suspects Tsai wants to declare the island s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s security. Taiwan is well equipped with mostly U.S. weapons but has been pressing for more advanced equipment to deal with what it sees as a rising threat from China. The United States is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"worldnews\",\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 716,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"September 2, 2017 \",\n          \"February 2, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

For Trump to actually be impeached, articles must pass the House with a majority vote   something that will be borderline impossible in a Republican-controlled chamber.There is hope, however, as Texas Republican Representative Al Green has publicly expressed his support for the impeachment of President Trump, so hopefully, others might follow suit.Sherman s article lists other actions that President Trump has allegedly taken, besides the Comey firing, that could potentially be grounds for his impeachment. These include James Comey s allegation that Trump asked him to  let this go  in reference to an FBI investigation into Michael Flynn, the former National Security Advisor, and his ties to Russia.Comey s firing is still the cornerstone of the article. With Sherman claiming that Trump did so in relation to the handling of the Russia investigation, the California Representative might have a valid point   namely the President telling NBC s Lester Holt,  When I decided to just do it, I said to myself   I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.

The tweet was a meme with the Star of David slapped over an anti-Hillary Clinton graphic  a meme that was traced back to a website frequented by white supremacists and neo-Nazis. It doesn t seem possible, but Trump has managed to make the situation even worse.At a rally in Ohio on Wednesday night, Trump went on an insane rant about how unfair it was that his offensive tweet had to be taken down and is getting so much negative attention. The Donald repeatedly insisted that the Star of David is actually just a regular star (or a sheriff s star) and that the  dishonest  media are actually the ones who are profiling   not him. Trump went out of his way to go after CNN, or the  Clinton News Network,  for rightfully calling him out on the anti-Semitic tweet, labeling the network and the rest of the media  sick. Then, Trump complained that he d had to alter the meme (by putting a circle over the Star of David) and pull the original off of social media. He whined that his social media director, Dan Scavino,  shouldn t have taken it down. TwitterYou can watch Trump throw a temper tantrum about not being able to show his true bigot colors freely below:It s clear that Trump doesn t give a sh*t if his meme carried a super offensive or oppressive message. All that matters in Trump s mind is that he s right, everyone else is wrong, and he can do whatever the hell he wants without being called out on his bigotry.Featured image via Gage Skidmore / Flickr\",\n          \"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - For months, U.S. President Donald Trump\\u2019s national security adviser and his chief strategist have battled for influence behind the scenes, and their feud may force another shake-up at the White House. The dispute between Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster and political strategist Stephen Bannon has reached a level of animosity that is destabilizing Trump\\u2019s team of top advisers just as the administration tries to regain lost momentum, three senior officials said.  Under pressure from moderate Republicans to fire Bannon, Trump declined to publicly back him on Tuesday, although he left his options open. \\u201cWe\\u2019ll see what happens with Mr. Bannon,\\u201d he told reporters at Trump Tower in New York. Whatever Trump decides could chart the fate of a nuclear-weapons deal with Iran, U.S. troop deployments to Afghanistan and White House staffing decisions - all issues over which Bannon and McMaster have sparred. Bannon has been in a precarious position before but Trump has opted to keep him, in part because his chief strategist played a major role in his election victory and is backed by many of the president\\u2019s most loyal rank-and-file supporters. \\u201cThe president obviously is very nervous and afraid of firing him,\\u201d a source close to the White House told Reuters. The source floated the possibility that Bannon could be demoted instead of fired, noting that he might turn into a harsh critic of the administration if he is forced out of the inner circle.  Two other senior officials, both supporters of McMaster who asked not to be identified, said he blames Bannon for a series of attacks against him by right-wing website Breitbart News, which Bannon used to lead, and other far-right conservative groups.  In recent weeks, Breitbart has published a series of articles making a case for McMaster\\u2019s ouster on the basis that he is not a strong ally of Israel and that he has staffed the National Security Council with holdovers from the Obama administration. One of the senior officials said McMaster\\u2019s anger over the campaign \\u201cis known to the president\\u201d but declined to say whether the national security adviser had told Trump directly or through General John Kelly, an ally and the president\\u2019s new chief of staff. \\u201cMcMaster isn\\u2019t saying Bannon is the mastermind behind the campaign, but he does think Bannon could stop it if he wanted to,\\u201d said one of McMaster\\u2019s defenders. In a television interview on Sunday, McMaster repeatedly declined to answer when asked if he could work with Bannon. About their feud, Bannon declined to comment and McMaster was unavailable for comment. Instead of firing Bannon, Trump could move McMaster into a position outside the White House, possibly back to an active military command role, or keep both men where they are and insist on some form of truce. Bannon has survived other White House power struggles this year and established a detente with Trump\\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner after a scolding from the president. The two senior officials who support McMaster said Kelly is angry that the anti-McMaster campaign has made the White House appear chaotic, reflecting badly on him as he was brought in as chief of staff two weeks ago to restore order and discipline. Bannon sees himself as the defender of Trump\\u2019s nationalist base and has advocated for both an end or renegotiation of trade deals and a more isolationist approach to foreign affairs than McMaster.  He has pushed to scrap the 2015 nuclear-weapons agreement with Iran, which McMaster argues should remain in place, and has also proposed using contractors to fight the war in Afghanistan rather than expanding U.S. forces there, as McMaster has advocated.  McMaster is part of a more pragmatic group that Bannon likes to label \\u201cglobalists.\\u201d He drew the fury of Bannon\\u2019s supporters by recently overhauling the White House\\u2019s National Security Council, pushing out four staffers who were seen as close to Bannon. Conservative commentator Mike Cernovich is a Bannon ally and has been a vocal critic of McMaster, even leveling personal attacks against him. Cernovich says he does not talk directly to Bannon but praises him as an important counterweight to McMaster.  He also warns that the president would alienate his most loyal supporters if he fires Bannon. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think that people who like Trump are suddenly going to say, \\u2018We\\u2019re going to fight Trump.\\u2019 Instead they\\u2019ll say, \\u2018What\\u2019s the point of supporting him?\\u2019\\u201d Cernovich told Reuters. The conservative Jewish-American and pro-Israel group Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), which also has close ties to Bannon, has been one of McMaster\\u2019s sharpest critics, urging Trump to reassign him away from policy areas dealing with Israel and Iran.  Trump has himself backed McMaster, saying he was a \\u201cgood man and very pro-Israel\\u201d. A source close to the ZOA bristled at the suggestion that Bannon was influencing its approach and said it would not tone down the campaign against McMaster, despite entreaties by Bannon  to do so. \\u201cWe find it remarkably offensive that anyone would suggest that Steve Bannon or anyone else tells us what to say or what not to say,\\u201d the source said. \\u201cIt makes me feel awful that he\\u2019s getting blamed for this, but there\\u2019s nothing I can do about it.\\u201d \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"Government News\",\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"fake\",\n          \"true\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

For Trump to actually be impeached, articles must pass the House with a majority vote   something that will be borderline impossible in a Republican-controlled chamber.There is hope, however, as Texas Republican Representative Al Green has publicly expressed his support for the impeachment of President Trump, so hopefully, others might follow suit.Sherman s article lists other actions that President Trump has allegedly taken, besides the Comey firing, that could potentially be grounds for his impeachment. These include James Comey s allegation that Trump asked him to  let this go  in reference to an FBI investigation into Michael Flynn, the former National Security Advisor, and his ties to Russia.Comey s firing is still the cornerstone of the article. With Sherman claiming that Trump did so in relation to the handling of the Russia investigation, the California Representative might have a valid point   namely the President telling NBC s Lester Holt,  When I decided to just do it, I said to myself   I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.

When he first started circulating drafts of the article in June, fellow Democratic Representative Michael Capuano reportedly stood up at a party meeting and branded Sherman as  selfish.

The tweet was a meme with the Star of David slapped over an anti-Hillary Clinton graphic  a meme that was traced back to a website frequented by white supremacists and neo-Nazis. It doesn t seem possible, but Trump has managed to make the situation even worse.At a rally in Ohio on Wednesday night, Trump went on an insane rant about how unfair it was that his offensive tweet had to be taken down and is getting so much negative attention. The Donald repeatedly insisted that the Star of David is actually just a regular star (or a sheriff s star) and that the  dishonest  media are actually the ones who are profiling   not him. Trump went out of his way to go after CNN, or the  Clinton News Network,  for rightfully calling him out on the anti-Semitic tweet, labeling the network and the rest of the media  sick. Then, Trump complained that he d had to alter the meme (by putting a circle over the Star of David) and pull the original off of social media. He whined that his social media director, Dan Scavino,  shouldn t have taken it down. TwitterYou can watch Trump throw a temper tantrum about not being able to show his true bigot colors freely below:It s clear that Trump doesn t give a sh*t if his meme carried a super offensive or oppressive message. All that matters in Trump s mind is that he s right, everyone else is wrong, and he can do whatever the hell he wants without being called out on his bigotry.Featured image via Gage Skidmore / Flickr\",\n          \"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - For months, U.S. President Donald Trump\\u2019s national security adviser and his chief strategist have battled for influence behind the scenes, and their feud may force another shake-up at the White House. The dispute between Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster and political strategist Stephen Bannon has reached a level of animosity that is destabilizing Trump\\u2019s team of top advisers just as the administration tries to regain lost momentum, three senior officials said.  Under pressure from moderate Republicans to fire Bannon, Trump declined to publicly back him on Tuesday, although he left his options open. \\u201cWe\\u2019ll see what happens with Mr. Bannon,\\u201d he told reporters at Trump Tower in New York. Whatever Trump decides could chart the fate of a nuclear-weapons deal with Iran, U.S. troop deployments to Afghanistan and White House staffing decisions - all issues over which Bannon and McMaster have sparred. Bannon has been in a precarious position before but Trump has opted to keep him, in part because his chief strategist played a major role in his election victory and is backed by many of the president\\u2019s most loyal rank-and-file supporters. \\u201cThe president obviously is very nervous and afraid of firing him,\\u201d a source close to the White House told Reuters. The source floated the possibility that Bannon could be demoted instead of fired, noting that he might turn into a harsh critic of the administration if he is forced out of the inner circle.  Two other senior officials, both supporters of McMaster who asked not to be identified, said he blames Bannon for a series of attacks against him by right-wing website Breitbart News, which Bannon used to lead, and other far-right conservative groups.  In recent weeks, Breitbart has published a series of articles making a case for McMaster\\u2019s ouster on the basis that he is not a strong ally of Israel and that he has staffed the National Security Council with holdovers from the Obama administration. One of the senior officials said McMaster\\u2019s anger over the campaign \\u201cis known to the president\\u201d but declined to say whether the national security adviser had told Trump directly or through General John Kelly, an ally and the president\\u2019s new chief of staff. \\u201cMcMaster isn\\u2019t saying Bannon is the mastermind behind the campaign, but he does think Bannon could stop it if he wanted to,\\u201d said one of McMaster\\u2019s defenders. In a television interview on Sunday, McMaster repeatedly declined to answer when asked if he could work with Bannon. About their feud, Bannon declined to comment and McMaster was unavailable for comment. Instead of firing Bannon, Trump could move McMaster into a position outside the White House, possibly back to an active military command role, or keep both men where they are and insist on some form of truce. Bannon has survived other White House power struggles this year and established a detente with Trump\\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner after a scolding from the president. The two senior officials who support McMaster said Kelly is angry that the anti-McMaster campaign has made the White House appear chaotic, reflecting badly on him as he was brought in as chief of staff two weeks ago to restore order and discipline. Bannon sees himself as the defender of Trump\\u2019s nationalist base and has advocated for both an end or renegotiation of trade deals and a more isolationist approach to foreign affairs than McMaster.  He has pushed to scrap the 2015 nuclear-weapons agreement with Iran, which McMaster argues should remain in place, and has also proposed using contractors to fight the war in Afghanistan rather than expanding U.S. forces there, as McMaster has advocated.  McMaster is part of a more pragmatic group that Bannon likes to label \\u201cglobalists.\\u201d He drew the fury of Bannon\\u2019s supporters by recently overhauling the White House\\u2019s National Security Council, pushing out four staffers who were seen as close to Bannon. Conservative commentator Mike Cernovich is a Bannon ally and has been a vocal critic of McMaster, even leveling personal attacks against him. Cernovich says he does not talk directly to Bannon but praises him as an important counterweight to McMaster.  He also warns that the president would alienate his most loyal supporters if he fires Bannon. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think that people who like Trump are suddenly going to say, \\u2018We\\u2019re going to fight Trump.\\u2019 Instead they\\u2019ll say, \\u2018What\\u2019s the point of supporting him?\\u2019\\u201d Cernovich told Reuters. The conservative Jewish-American and pro-Israel group Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), which also has close ties to Bannon, has been one of McMaster\\u2019s sharpest critics, urging Trump to reassign him away from policy areas dealing with Israel and Iran.  Trump has himself backed McMaster, saying he was a \\u201cgood man and very pro-Israel\\u201d. A source close to the ZOA bristled at the suggestion that Bannon was influencing its approach and said it would not tone down the campaign against McMaster, despite entreaties by Bannon  to do so. \\u201cWe find it remarkably offensive that anyone would suggest that Steve Bannon or anyone else tells us what to say or what not to say,\\u201d the source said. \\u201cIt makes me feel awful that he\\u2019s getting blamed for this, but there\\u2019s nothing I can do about it.\\u201d \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"Government News\",\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"fake\",\n          \"true\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

For Trump to actually be impeached, articles must pass the House with a majority vote   something that will be borderline impossible in a Republican-controlled chamber.There is hope, however, as Texas Republican Representative Al Green has publicly expressed his support for the impeachment of President Trump, so hopefully, others might follow suit.Sherman s article lists other actions that President Trump has allegedly taken, besides the Comey firing, that could potentially be grounds for his impeachment. These include James Comey s allegation that Trump asked him to  let this go  in reference to an FBI investigation into Michael Flynn, the former National Security Advisor, and his ties to Russia.Comey s firing is still the cornerstone of the article. With Sherman claiming that Trump did so in relation to the handling of the Russia investigation, the California Representative might have a valid point   namely the President telling NBC s Lester Holt,  When I decided to just do it, I said to myself   I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.

The tweet was a meme with the Star of David slapped over an anti-Hillary Clinton graphic  a meme that was traced back to a website frequented by white supremacists and neo-Nazis. It doesn t seem possible, but Trump has managed to make the situation even worse.At a rally in Ohio on Wednesday night, Trump went on an insane rant about how unfair it was that his offensive tweet had to be taken down and is getting so much negative attention. The Donald repeatedly insisted that the Star of David is actually just a regular star (or a sheriff s star) and that the  dishonest  media are actually the ones who are profiling   not him. Trump went out of his way to go after CNN, or the  Clinton News Network,  for rightfully calling him out on the anti-Semitic tweet, labeling the network and the rest of the media  sick. Then, Trump complained that he d had to alter the meme (by putting a circle over the Star of David) and pull the original off of social media. He whined that his social media director, Dan Scavino,  shouldn t have taken it down. TwitterYou can watch Trump throw a temper tantrum about not being able to show his true bigot colors freely below:It s clear that Trump doesn t give a sh*t if his meme carried a super offensive or oppressive message. All that matters in Trump s mind is that he s right, everyone else is wrong, and he can do whatever the hell he wants without being called out on his bigotry.Featured image via Gage Skidmore / Flickr\",\n          \"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - For months, U.S. President Donald Trump\\u2019s national security adviser and his chief strategist have battled for influence behind the scenes, and their feud may force another shake-up at the White House. The dispute between Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster and political strategist Stephen Bannon has reached a level of animosity that is destabilizing Trump\\u2019s team of top advisers just as the administration tries to regain lost momentum, three senior officials said.  Under pressure from moderate Republicans to fire Bannon, Trump declined to publicly back him on Tuesday, although he left his options open. \\u201cWe\\u2019ll see what happens with Mr. Bannon,\\u201d he told reporters at Trump Tower in New York. Whatever Trump decides could chart the fate of a nuclear-weapons deal with Iran, U.S. troop deployments to Afghanistan and White House staffing decisions - all issues over which Bannon and McMaster have sparred. Bannon has been in a precarious position before but Trump has opted to keep him, in part because his chief strategist played a major role in his election victory and is backed by many of the president\\u2019s most loyal rank-and-file supporters. \\u201cThe president obviously is very nervous and afraid of firing him,\\u201d a source close to the White House told Reuters. The source floated the possibility that Bannon could be demoted instead of fired, noting that he might turn into a harsh critic of the administration if he is forced out of the inner circle.  Two other senior officials, both supporters of McMaster who asked not to be identified, said he blames Bannon for a series of attacks against him by right-wing website Breitbart News, which Bannon used to lead, and other far-right conservative groups.  In recent weeks, Breitbart has published a series of articles making a case for McMaster\\u2019s ouster on the basis that he is not a strong ally of Israel and that he has staffed the National Security Council with holdovers from the Obama administration. One of the senior officials said McMaster\\u2019s anger over the campaign \\u201cis known to the president\\u201d but declined to say whether the national security adviser had told Trump directly or through General John Kelly, an ally and the president\\u2019s new chief of staff. \\u201cMcMaster isn\\u2019t saying Bannon is the mastermind behind the campaign, but he does think Bannon could stop it if he wanted to,\\u201d said one of McMaster\\u2019s defenders. In a television interview on Sunday, McMaster repeatedly declined to answer when asked if he could work with Bannon. About their feud, Bannon declined to comment and McMaster was unavailable for comment. Instead of firing Bannon, Trump could move McMaster into a position outside the White House, possibly back to an active military command role, or keep both men where they are and insist on some form of truce. Bannon has survived other White House power struggles this year and established a detente with Trump\\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner after a scolding from the president. The two senior officials who support McMaster said Kelly is angry that the anti-McMaster campaign has made the White House appear chaotic, reflecting badly on him as he was brought in as chief of staff two weeks ago to restore order and discipline. Bannon sees himself as the defender of Trump\\u2019s nationalist base and has advocated for both an end or renegotiation of trade deals and a more isolationist approach to foreign affairs than McMaster.  He has pushed to scrap the 2015 nuclear-weapons agreement with Iran, which McMaster argues should remain in place, and has also proposed using contractors to fight the war in Afghanistan rather than expanding U.S. forces there, as McMaster has advocated.  McMaster is part of a more pragmatic group that Bannon likes to label \\u201cglobalists.\\u201d He drew the fury of Bannon\\u2019s supporters by recently overhauling the White House\\u2019s National Security Council, pushing out four staffers who were seen as close to Bannon. Conservative commentator Mike Cernovich is a Bannon ally and has been a vocal critic of McMaster, even leveling personal attacks against him. Cernovich says he does not talk directly to Bannon but praises him as an important counterweight to McMaster.  He also warns that the president would alienate his most loyal supporters if he fires Bannon. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think that people who like Trump are suddenly going to say, \\u2018We\\u2019re going to fight Trump.\\u2019 Instead they\\u2019ll say, \\u2018What\\u2019s the point of supporting him?\\u2019\\u201d Cernovich told Reuters. The conservative Jewish-American and pro-Israel group Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), which also has close ties to Bannon, has been one of McMaster\\u2019s sharpest critics, urging Trump to reassign him away from policy areas dealing with Israel and Iran.  Trump has himself backed McMaster, saying he was a \\u201cgood man and very pro-Israel\\u201d. A source close to the ZOA bristled at the suggestion that Bannon was influencing its approach and said it would not tone down the campaign against McMaster, despite entreaties by Bannon  to do so. \\u201cWe find it remarkably offensive that anyone would suggest that Steve Bannon or anyone else tells us what to say or what not to say,\\u201d the source said. \\u201cIt makes me feel awful that he\\u2019s getting blamed for this, but there\\u2019s nothing I can do about it.\\u201d \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"fake\",\n          \"true\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The bodies were found about 310 km (190 miles) southwest of the coastal city of Tobruk, said Ahmed al-Mismari, spokesman for the eastern-based Libyan National Army. He said the area was still being searched and no more details were available about the migrants  identities. In the past, patrols and rescuers have recovered the bodies of Egyptian migrants who have perished after being stranded or abandoned by smugglers in Libya s eastern desert.  Some migrate to Libya to search for work, and some try to reach Europe by boat.  \",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said it was necessary to do everything possible to make progress on the nuclear deal with Iran and that he did not see any indications during a visit to the United States that Washington would terminate it.

While US citizens were begging for disaster relief, Trump was staying at his golf club, turning his back on them. The Washington Post ran a story about Trump s negligence last night, stating that Trump went MIA for four entire days while Puerto Rico suffered, focusing all of his attention on attacking NFL players and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.After seeing the Washington Post s report, a former Obama administration official lashed out at Trump on Twitter, providing the undeserving POTUS with a much needed reality check   and he didn t hold back as he said Trump  makes me so mad I could spit.  Former US Foreign Disaster Assistance chief Jeremy Konyndyk noted how  damning  the report was and tore the Trump administration a new one. In a massive tweetstorm, Konyndyk gave Trump a lesson he ll never forget:        This is one of the most brutal critiques we ve gotten so far in regards to Trump s handling of Puerto Rico.  Malpractice  is truly a perfect word, because Trump really should have been all over this. It is his duty as POTUS   and yet he has almost completely ignored the situation. People are dying and begging for assistance, and Trump has jetted off to his golf course in New Jersey for the weekend. We cannot think of a more self-centered, irresponsible response to a major crisis that has already resulted in the loss of human life. Trump has made it perfectly clear that he doesn t give a damn.America has truly been put in danger with Trump as President of the United States. Puerto Rico proves that he is unfit to lead a country and be responsible for the lives of its citizens.Featured image via Pool / Getty Images\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"true\",\n          \"fake\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
